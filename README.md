## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mojtaba. I am 34 years old. I started coding when I was 17, I learned how to create a website and run it, then I started creating websites for different customers, one of my customers was the CEO at Marcopolo Iran Touring Company witch invited me for a full-time job in the company in Tehran as Web Developer, with the experience I got in one of the biggest travel company in Iran, I started my own business, right now I own my travel agency which works in online hotel booking for Iranian and travels planning for tourists all over the world which want travel to Iran.

## My Experiences
Over the years I have implemented various websites with PHP. For some projects, I have used pure PHP and for others, I have used CodeIgniter and Laravel frameworks. I am also familiar with NodeJS and Golang and have run a number of small projects with them and can now run larger projects. I am not an expert in any programming language but I have worked with many of them and I can use them and implement projects whenever needed. During project construction, I learn everything that is needed, and in general, I believe that a good programmer is someone who can use different programming languages â€‹â€‹and tools according to the needs of a project because programming science is evolving every day. The ability to solve problems and be up-to-date is more important than mastering the details of a programming language.
